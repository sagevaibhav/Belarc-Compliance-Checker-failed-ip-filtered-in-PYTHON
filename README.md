## Overview
Belarc Compliance Checker is a Python-based tool that automates the process of analyzing Belarc Advisor HTML reports for compliance. It searches for specific sentences in the HTML files and identifies whether they pass or fail compliance checks based on accompanying images (`yes.gif` or `no.gif`). The tool is designed with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using `Tkinter`.
